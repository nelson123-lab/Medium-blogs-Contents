Before we start a small intro about why we require Airflow. Airflow is an open source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. We usually use it for cron job the job that are scheduled tasks that run automatically at specified intervals on Unix-like operating systems. eg: recommendation system if our data is not being collected we won't get recommendations based on the recent data that we created.
There are several ways in which we can use Airflow in Windows. We will be discussing two ways in which how we can create our first DAG.
Using Docker
Using the WSL system ( Windows Linux subsystem.)
